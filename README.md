# Awesome-Player
Star Lord loves to hear A wesome Mix(V olume 1) on his Sony W alkman but unfortunately it broke during an inter galactic fight. Since Star lord can’ t fight without listening to music, Rocket decides to help his friend. He had earlier stolen a W indows tablet for Star Lord from The Collector ’s collection. But unfortunately , this tablet didn’ t have any music player installed on it. Rocket can’ t risk wasting time to search a new device for Star Lord, as he needs him back on the field ASAP . So he has asked the great coders of MNNIT to build a Music Player for that tablet. (There is no internet in space. The rabbit can’ t code so you Gotta code everything yourself) He will be arriving at MNNIT on August 27th. So be prepared with the music player .
